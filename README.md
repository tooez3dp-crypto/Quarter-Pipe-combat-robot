# Quarter-Pipe-combat-robot
A wedge-style combat robot that looks like a quarter pipe! 
This Combat robot is my first project that will hopefully dominate the field in competition.
I made this project because I have always been interested in combat robotics, and I saw my engineering drawing capstone project as the perfect opportunity to make one.
