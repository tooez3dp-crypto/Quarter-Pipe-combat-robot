# Quarter-Pipe-combat-robot
A wedge-style combat robot that looks like a quarter pipe! 
This Combat robot is my first project that will hopefully dominate the field in competition.
I made this project because I have always been interested in combat robotics, and I saw my engineering drawing capstone project as the perfect opportunity to make one. 
(Note that this is an unfinished project)

It looks a bit empty right here, but it has all the required space for the parts. I just thought it would weigh less if it were emptier. The Circles you see are for the screws.
# Wiring Diagram
Here is the basic wiring diagram. It is not finished, and I will be updating it soon.
