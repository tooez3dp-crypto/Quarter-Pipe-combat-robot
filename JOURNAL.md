# Journal
  The following is my journal I have been keeping as I worked on the project. It is not done yet.
  # Starting the design (December 8, 2025)
  Today, I looked into designs for a combat robot and chose to make a wedge-style weapon. I found some electronic components to use and am starting the CAD process for design. Will update later on the modeling process!

  # Research and start of designs. (Later on December 8, 2025)
  I spent quite some time researching how these combat robots work. I watched some makers muse tutorials, and I was able to get the general idea of what I should do. I drew up a basic sketch that is not final for sure, but it will help me with the design process.

  # Rough 3d model (December 9, 2025)
  I started modeling the robot. All is well so far. I renamed the robot "Quarter Pipe" because of its appearance. Combat robots are not incredibly difficult to model, and it's the electronics that will require the most time. 
I still have to model the wheels and add some good-looking details, but I expect to complete the digital part (Including wiring diagrams) this week. Of course, this is an engineering project, so nothing will go to plan.

 # Finished 3d model!
